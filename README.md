# LifeAssistant

My problem is: 
 1. I own several repos to record different fileds knowledge, 
 i need assistant to pick up new things and old things what i need to review, and to tell me what i need to do today?
 
 2. I own a project to try to do private plan, while i always forget it
 I need a platform to send message to me in my phone and my PC to mention 
 
 3. I use fanqie work method, but i need to add task by myself, and i always forget to use it
 I need to integrate fanqie and other efficient tool to help me improve production
 
 My plan is:
  1. Try to find a open source project to fulfile my need, strat it
  2. Improve it during working
  3. Try to make a good architecture to integrate some third-party tools
